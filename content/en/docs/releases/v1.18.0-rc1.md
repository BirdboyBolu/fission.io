## Features

## Fixes

## Updates

## Deprecation

- HTTPTrigger/Route creation from Fission CLI is deprecated. Use `fission route create` instead. [PR #2171](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2171)
- We have deprecated `Spec.Method` in HTTPTrigger since 1.13.0, please use `Spec.Methods` instead.

## Removed

### Azure Storage Queue and Nats traditional connector

With the addition of KEDA connectors, we have removed the following connectors type fission.

- Remove deprecated Fission Azure Storage Queue connector [\#2404](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2404) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))
- Remove deprecated Fission Nats connector [\#2403](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2403) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))

### Prometheus chart dependency

We have removed the prometheus dependency because it's not required by default by fission. If you want to use canary functions or checkout fission metrics, we recommend using [prometheus-community/prometheus](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/prometheus) or [prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack).

- \[helm chart\] Remove prometheus chart dependency from Fission [\#2371](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2371) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))

### Opentracing support removed

With addition of OpenTelemetry, we have removed OpenTracing instrumentation.
Since OpenTelemetry is a superset of OpenTracing, we recommend using OpenTelemetry for tracing.

- cleanup: Remove Opentracing support as no active users [\#2196](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2196) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))
- removed unused reference of TRACING\_SAMPLING\_RATE [\#2498](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2498) ([shubham-bansal96](https://github.com/shubham-bansal96))
